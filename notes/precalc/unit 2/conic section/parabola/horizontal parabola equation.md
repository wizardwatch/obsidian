$(y-k)^2=4p(x-h)$

remember, h and k are at the vertex, not the focus.
vertex(h,k)
focus(h+p, k)
if p is positive it opens to the right, if p is negative it opens to the left
```
Find p using $$\frac {focus(x) + directrix} {2}$$ if the directrix is smaller than the focus or  $$\frac {focus(x) - directrix} {2}$$ if the directrix is greater than the focus
```
Find p by finding the absolute value of $$\frac {focus(X) - directrix} {2}$$. If the graph opens to the right, make p positive. If it opens to the left make it negative.
directrix is x =
