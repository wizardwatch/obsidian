$(x-h) ^ 2 = 4p(y-k)$ 

remember, h and k are at the vertex, not the focus.
vertex(h,k)
focus(h, k+p)
if p is positive it opens up, if p is negative it opens down
``` Find p using $$\frac {focus(Y) + directrix} {2}$$ if the directrix is smaller than the focus or  $$\frac {focus(Y) - directrix} {2}$$ if the directrix is greater than the focus```
Find p by finding the absolute value of $$\frac {focus(Y) - directrix} {2}$$. If the graph opens up make p positive. If it opens down make p negative.
directrix is y =
