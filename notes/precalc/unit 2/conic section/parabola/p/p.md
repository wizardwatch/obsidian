P is half of the change, p can be positive or negative, from the vertex to the [[focus]] or [[directix]]. Find p using $\frac {focus(x or y) + directrix} {2}$

The P goes on the y coordinate when the parabola is vertical, on the x when the parabola is horizontal.

To find P look at either [[vertical parabola equation]] or [[horizontal parabola equation]].
