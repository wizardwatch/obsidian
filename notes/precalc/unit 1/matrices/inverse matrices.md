## finding an inverse matrix
1. If $A = \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}$ what does $A^{-1}$ equal?
2. To find $A^{-1}$  you must first find the [[determinate]].
	- If the determinate is zero, there is no inverse.
3. If the determinate is <b>not</b> zero than the answer can be found by transposing the values. The values should be transposed in the same way as the following for a 2 x 2 matrix
	- $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ab-bc}\begin{bmatrix}d&-b\\-c&a\end{bmatrix}$
		- The ab-bc portion is the determinant
