E = HV
- E is electromagnetic radiation (energy) 

- H is [[planck's constant]]

- V is frequency 


E = HC/λ
- E is electromagnetic radiation (energy) 

- H is [[planck's constant]]

- C is [[speed of  an electromagnetic wave]]

- λ is wave length

To find the energy in n [[mole]]s of photons, multiply by the number of particles in a [[mole]]
