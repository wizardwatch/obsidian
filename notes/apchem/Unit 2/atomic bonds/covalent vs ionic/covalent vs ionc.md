covalent and ionic bonds exist on a spectrum based on their atoms [[electronegativity]]. If the atoms in the bond have an electronegativity greater than 2.5 they are  generally [[ionic]]. If the difference is lower than 2.5 but greater than .5 then they are generally polar [[covalent]]. If they have an electronegativity difference of less than .5 they are generally nonpolar [[covalent]].
