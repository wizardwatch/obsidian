S = N - A

N = # of atoms 

A = number of valance electrons in the molecule
	- When you have a charged electron you invert the charge and add that to the available electrons. Ie a charge of -1 will result in one more available electrons. 

S = the number of bonds * 2
	- divide by two to find the number of bonds

Draw one line between for each bond. Each line will represent two shared electrons, one from the main atom, one from the secondary. 
Draw dots for every non shared atom.
