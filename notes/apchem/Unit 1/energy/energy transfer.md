Conservation of energy
- energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can be converted between forms. (ie chemical --> heat)

Transfer of energy
 - equation $\Delta E = q + w$
 - If the surroundings does work on the system, the [[work]] is positive
 - If the system warms up, if it takes energy from the surroundings, the [[Heat]] is positive
