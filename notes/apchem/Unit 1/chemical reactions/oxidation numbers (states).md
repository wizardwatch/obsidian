1. any atom in its elemental form has an oxidation state of 0
2. any monatomic ion has the same oxidation number as the charge
3. fluorine always has an oxidation state of -1
4. alkali metals have an oxidation sate of +1
5. hydrogen has an oxidation state o f+1 (unless bound to an alkali metal)
6. oxygen is usually -2 unless it is in a peroxide (O$_2^{-2}$)
7. all oxidation numbers must add up to the total charge of the substance
