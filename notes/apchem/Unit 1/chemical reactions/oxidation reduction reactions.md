- reduction (redox)
	- occurs when species(compounds) gain electrons
	- for a reaction to be qualified as a redox reaction, an oxidation state change must have occurred. 
- [[oxidation numbers (states)]]
	- occurs when species(compounds) lose electrons
- single replacement 
	- all single replacement reaction are oxidation but not all oxidation reactions are single replacement.
