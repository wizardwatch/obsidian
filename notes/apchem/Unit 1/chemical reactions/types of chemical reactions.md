1. precipitation
	-  double replacement
2. acid/base
	- acid/base (neutralization)
		- when a reaction between an acid an base is referred to as a neutralization reaction
			- always produces water and a [[salt]].
3. [[oxidation reduction reactions]]
4. net ionic equations
	- molecular
	- total ionic

spectator ions are not involved in the chemical reaction










solutions of the different ionic compound are mixed one compound is formed which is insoluble in aqueous solution and therefore precipitates.
